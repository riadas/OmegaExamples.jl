If the remainder of the script does not use the document or any of its children,
you can call free here to deallocate the memory. The memory will only get
deallocated by calling free or by exiting julia -- i.e., the memory allocated by
libxml2 will not get freed when the julia variable wrapping it goes out of
scope.
